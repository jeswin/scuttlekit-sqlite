## Creating a client

Include the scuttlekit-client library on a web page for easy access to the ScuttleKit SDK.
You can either add scuttlekit-client with a script tag, or use it via npm if you're using a JS bundler (like browserify, parcel or webpack).

```bash
# Either install via yarn/npm or include a <script> tag
yarn add scuttlekit-client
```

Start ScuttleKit on page load. If the app is not registered, the SDK will redirect the browser to a ScuttleKit hosted page (on port 1103) where the user can choose to grant requested permissions. After granting permissions (or denying them), the browser is redirected to a callback url with a token. The sdk will store the token in local storage for long term use, and is sent with every request made to the ScuttleKit server.

As part of the registration, the developer needs to supply the database schema to ScuttleKit.
In addition to various fields which make up the view, the schema defines primary keys and foreign keys as well. Primary keys will always be GUIDs.

See the example below.

```js
// Assuming you're using npm/yarn and a build tool like browserify or webpack
//   call this function after the page Loads.
import ScuttleKit from "scuttlekit-client";

// Unique name for your app.
const appName = "scuttledo";

// Your app/schema version
// This is stored against each record.
const version = "1.0.0";

//Which version of the ScuttleKit SDK are you targeting?
//If a lower version is installed on the user's computer, an error is displayed.
const sdkCompatibility = "^0.0.1";

const schema = {
  tables: {
    todo: {
      fields: {
        text: { type: "string", maxLength: 200 },
        dueDate: { type: "string" },
        completed: { type: "boolean" },
        timestamp: { type: "number", required: false },
        listId: { type: "string" }
      },
      encrypted: { type: "boolean" },
      foreignKeys: [{ field: "listId", table: "lists" }]
    },
    list: {
      fields: {
        name: { type: "string" }
      }
    }
  }
};

async function onLoad() {
  const sdk = new ScuttleKit();
  sdk.init({
    app,
    version,
    registrationUrl: "/register",
    services: { sqlite: { schema } }
  });
}
```

### Reading Data

To access the underlying sqlite database, use the getService() API.
Every row will have a primary key named \_\_id.

```js
async function loadTodos(date) {
  const db = sdk.getService("sqlite");
  return await db.query(`SELECT * FROM todos WHERE date='$date'`, {
    $date: date
  });
}
```

You can use joins, sure. Remember that the primary key is named \_\_id.

```js
async function loadTodosByListName(list) {
  const db = sdk.getService("sqlite");
  return await db.query(
    `SELECT * FROM todos JOIN lists ON todos.listId = lists.__id WHERE lists.name='$list'`,
    { $list: list }
  );
}
```

### Insert a Row

Insert an object. The primary key is an autogenerated number that keeps increases, but may have gaps.
The newly generated \_\_id is returned by the insert() function.

```js
async function addTodo(todo) {
  const db = sdk.getService("sqlite");
  const todo = {
    task: "But oranges",
    priority: 1,
    dueDate: "13-04-2018"
  };
  const result = await db.insert("todo", todo);
  console.log("The primary key is", result.__id);
}
```

Corresponding SSB write:

```js
sbot.publish({
  type: "scuttledo-todo",
  __id: "your-feed-id_33", //record 33
  task: "But oranges",
  priority: 1,
  dueDate: "13-04-2018",
  __permissions: [{ user: "your-id", owner: true, fields: [] }],
  __deleted: false
});
```

### Update a Row

Update an object. Make sure you pass in the primary key, in addition to the fields to be updated.
If \_\_id is missing, the statement will not execute.

```js
async function setCompleted(id) {
  const db = sdk.getService("sqlite");
  return await db.update("todo", { __id: id, completed: true });
}
```

Corresponding SSB write:

```js
sbot.publish({
  type: "scuttledo-todo",
  __id,
  completed: true
});
```

### Delete a Row

Delete a todo. Remember that the data is only deleted from the sqlite view, and will always reside in the append-only SSB log.

```js
async function deleteTodo(id) {
  const db = sdk.getService("sqlite");
  return await db.del("todo", { __id: id });
}
```

Corresponding SSB write:

```js
sbot.publish({
  type: "scuttledo-todo",
  __id,
  __isDeleted: true
});
```

## Permissions

When a row is written, a set of permissions are also written. The permissions array governs how the row may be modified.
Each permissions object in the array has three propertyies:

* user: the public key of a user
* owner: boolean which gives the user full access including delete, and changing permissions.
* fields: An array of fields to which a user has access. '\*' signifies access to all fields.

The author of the row will usually set oneself as the owner, getting complete access to the row.
An owner can modify any field in the row, or delete or, or change permissions. The toolkit ensures that atleast one person owns the row.

Here's how Alice can allow Bob to edit a Todo. Bob can edit all fields, but cannot delete or change permissions.

```js
async function createSharedTodo(todo) {
  const db = sdk.getService("sqlite");
  return await db.insert("todo", todo, {
    permissions: [
      { user: "alices-public-key", owner: true },
      { user: "bobs-public-key", fields: ["*"] }
    ]
  });
}
```

Bob can now edit an entry created by Alice. In the following example, assume that '\_\_id' corresponds to a todo originally created by his friend Alice.

```js
async function completeSharedTodo(__id) {
  const db = sdk.getService("sqlite");
  return await db.update("todo", { __id, completed: true });
}
```

Write permissions can be restricted to specific fields.
In the following example, Bob is only allowed to edit the 'completed' field.

```js
async function createSharedTodo(todo) {
  const db = sdk.getService("sqlite");
  return await db.insert("todo", todo, {
    permissions: [
      { user: "alices-public-key", owner: true },
      { user: "bobs-public-key", fields: ["completed"] }
    ]
  });
}
```

Alice can modify permissions during updation as well, and not just during an insert.
Only owners can do that.

```js
async function assignPermissions(id) {
  const db = sdk.getService("sqlite");
  return await db.update(
    "todo",
    { id },
    {
      permissions: [
        { user: "alices-public-key", owner: true },
        { user: "bobs-public-key", fields: ["completed"] }
      ]
    }
  );
}
```

### Transactions

A ScuttleKit transaction means that the view will not update until the "transaction complete" message is received.

```js
async function addTodoAndDeleteAnother(newTodo, oldTodoId) {
  const db = sdk.getService("sqlite");
  const transaction = db.createTransaction();
  await db.insert("todo", newTodo, { transaction });
  await db.del("todo", oldTodoId, { transaction });
  await transaction.complete();
}
```

Corresponding SSB write:

```js
// Add a todo
sbot.publish({
  type: "scuttledo-todo",
  id: newTodo.id,
  // other fields...
  transaction: "some-random-autogenerated-id"
});

// Delete another todos
sbot.publish({
  type: "scuttledo-todo",
  id: oldTodoId,
  __isDeleted: true,
  transaction: "some-random-autogenerated-id"
});

// Complete the transaction
sbot.publish({
  type: "scuttledo-transaction",
  transaction: "some-random-autogenerated-id"
});
```

Note that the data in the transaction will be visible in raw SSB logs, even if the transaction was not committed.

### Multisig Transactions

### Schema Changes

It is inevitable that at some point you'll make changes to the schema. To support this, ScuttleKit allows you to define transforms which can convert data from an earlier schema into a newer one.
Transform Functions are run when the schema version changes - the SSB log is replayed and the transform function will be called for each entry.
The function should return an object or throw an Error - if an error is thrown, it is logged and the next record is processed.

Every SSB log entry made via ScuttleKit will contain an \_\_schema property, which signifies the schema at the time of record creation.
The transform function could use the version to decide how to interpret a record.

```js
const schema = {
  tables: {
    // ...omitted
  },

  // Example: Versions prior to 0.1.0, did not have firstName and lastName.
  // Versions between 0.1.0 and 0.2.1 used fname and lname as field names.
  // We're going to convert it to firstName and lastName.
  transform: logEntry => {
    if (logEntry.__schema <= "0.1.0") {
      return {
        firstName: logEntry.name.split(" ")[0],
        lastName: logEntry.name.split(" ")[1],
        age: logEntry.age
      };
    } else if (logEntry.__schema <= "0.2.1" && logEntry.__schema > "0.1.0") {
      return {
        firstName: logEntry.fname,
        lastName: logEntry.lname,
        age: logEntry.age
      };
    }
  }
};
```

There's an onTransformComplete callback available which lets you make additional modifications to a database after all entries have been transformed.
The onTransformComplete function is regular function in which the standard database API (insert, update etc) is available.
The key difference is that it DOES NOT write the changes back to the SSB log. Use this sparingly - it's more like an escape hatch.

```js
const schema = {
  tables: {
    todo: {
      // ...omitted
    },
    list: {
      // ...omitted
    }
  },

  transform: (logEntry) => {
    // ...omitted
  },

  //Note that the db writes in onTransformComplete skip the SSB log.
  onTransformComplete: (db) => {
    const todos = await db.query("SELECT * FROM todos");
    const assigneeNames = todos.map(t => t.assignee);
    for (const assigneeName of assigneeNames) {
      db.insert("assignee", { name: assigneeName })
    }
  }
};
```
